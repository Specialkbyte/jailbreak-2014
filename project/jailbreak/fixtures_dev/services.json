Last year we had Sean Blanchfield, co-founder and ex-CTO of Demonware, and speakers from MongoDB. This year we have speakers from BatGames, Bullet, BrimBrothers and GetHealth confirmed for this year already.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We run a huge number of workshops and tutorials during the year to teach members how to code, manage and repair computers. Many of our tutorials. assume no knowledge of programming and is a great way to pick up a new language or to learn how to code for the first time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also run a great number movie nights, programming competitions and game tournaments. The highlight of our events calendar is our (in)famous Christmas party and end of the year AGM.</p>",

Ireland\u2019s largest, most ambitious and craziest student charity event, Jailbreak raises much needed funds for Amnesty International and St. Vincent De Paul. This year shall see over 100 teams from every corner of Ireland competing to bring back the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Jailbreak14\">#Jailbreak14</a> crown to UCD, NUIG, UCC or TCD. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, over \u20ac17,000 was raised by the event for Amnesty International and St. Vincent de Paul, with all participants coming from Trinity College. The winning team, Claire Cullen and Matthew Hainbach, made it as far as Miramar in Argentina, more than 7,000 miles away with only 25 miles separating them from the runners up. They even convinced Irish musician Chris de Burgh to pay for their ticket home. Other competitors reached Brunei, Indonesia, Australia (though outside the 36 hour time limit) and the Vatican City. The competition was featured by TIME Magazine, RTE, TV3, and national media outlets in Australia and Argentina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, Jailbreak has been expanded to include the four universities from across Ireland. The number of participants has also increased from 68 to over 200, with over \u20ac10,000 already raised for the two charities. Jailbreak 2014 will be officially launched in the Great Hall in Kilmainham Gaol, Europe\u2019s largest abandoned jail, on Saturday 22nd February at 9am. As Jailbreak is now a national event, participants can choose to start from Kilmainham Gaol, Cork Gaol or Eyre Square. The winning team is the team who is the furthest distance from their starting point at 9pm on Sunday, 36 hours later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An exciting new feature this year is the <a href=\"/snapchat-rat-race/\">#SnapChatRatRace</a>, featuring The Jailbreak Rat. The #SnapChatRatRace challenges teams to find the Jailbreak rat hidden somewhere in Europe using only clues sent from the Rat\u2019s SnapChat account \u201cTheJailbreakRat\u201d.  The Jailbreak Rat has broken out of Kilmainham Gaol, and this weekend will board a plane to a mystery location. Using SnapChat, he will send photographs with hints as to his location to all participants. After each SnapChat, he will remain in that location for 30 minutes. The winners of the #SnapChatRatRace are the first team to locate the Jailbreak Rat and post a photograph online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can follow the competition with the official hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Jailbreak14\">#Jailbreak14</a> and donations can be made through the <a href=\"http://facebok.com/jailbreakhq/\">Facebook page</a>.</p>",
